;1 Proving the Associativity law for the list monad
;;- associative:
;;(bind-list (bind-list ma f) g) ≡ (bind-list ma (λ (a) (bind-list (f a) g)))
;;The bind-list function is defined in monads.rkt as append-map f ls, therefore we can rewrite this expression as
;;(append-map (append-map ma f) g) ≡ (append-map ma (λ (a) (append-map (f a) g)))
;;append map is defined in racket as:
;(define append-map
;  (λ (f ls)
;    (foldr append (map f ls) '())))
;

;The foldr function takes in 3 inputs, the procedure it wants, a function that will be executed and an empty list to store it in
;We will attempt to do a proof of induction.
;To start, the base case: (I resubstituted append-map for clarity
;(bind-list (bind-list ma f) g) ≡ (bind-list ma (λ (a) (bind-list (f a) g)))
;If given an empty list, with a procedure, both of the sides return null, which is the equivalence that we need to prove the base case
;For the inductive step, we have to assume the list ma is associative. Now we need to prove that it is associative when it is cons ma x.
;(bind-list (bind-list (cons ma 'x f) g) ≡ (bind-list (cons ma x) (λ (a) (bind-list (f a) g)))
;This is also equivalent when given actual values.
;Therefore, the consing of x with ma is the substitute for the normal k+1 inductive step, and since both sides are equivalent in the inductive step,
;we can say the inductive assumption holds and confirm that the associativity law for the list monad is true by induction.
